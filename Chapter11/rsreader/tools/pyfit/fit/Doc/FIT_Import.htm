<p>The Import fixture lets you control where FIT looks for fixture renames and remembered packages. Entries with a name in the first column only are remembered packages; entires with two names are fixture renames. A version of the table with only one column is acceptable.</p>
<p>The single entry version is for compatability with FitNesse.</p>
<p>It should be placed in the acceptance test before any fixtures that need it. The fit
package itself is always predeclared.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="53%" />
<col width="48%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td colspan="2">fit.Import</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>spam.eggs.toast</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>spaghetti.meatballs</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>fat</td>
<td>fat.Spec1_1Tests</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It also declares that any names which begin with fat. will be changed to begin with fat.Spec1_1Tests. This is one of the entries that is used to map the Fit 1.1 specification tests to a more specific location.</p>
<p>NOTE - use of this fixture is strongly discouraged. It's here because it's heavily used in tests created by FitNesse. Future versions of PyFit may make this fixture a comment. Either the <a class="reference" href="FIT_ConfigurationExit.htm">application configuration</a> facility or the <a class="reference" href="FIT_FixtureNames.htm">fixture renames</a> facility is a significantly better replacement.</p>
