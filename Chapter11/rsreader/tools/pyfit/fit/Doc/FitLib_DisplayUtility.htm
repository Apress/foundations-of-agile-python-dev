<p>The display utility is a PyFit enhancement to the Fit Library that allows you to display the current content of a collection within a DoFixture or a SequenceFixture. It's invoked by specifying $Display as the return type in the method metadata. The return value is a tuple with three values: the collection to display, the list of field names, and a dictionary containing the metadata for the requested fields.</p>
<p>The collection is specified in the same way as for RowFixture, ArrayFixture, SetFixture or SubsetFixture: as a list, a tuple, an iterator or a dictionary. If it's a dictionary, the entries will be sorted by key and then the values will be used as the collection.</p>
<p>The field list is a simple list of strings, one field name per string. The metadata dictionary is in the same format as the metadata dictionaries normally required for type adapters.</p>
<p>If metadata is missing, DisplayUtility will use str() to attempt to display the values. Fields that are not in an object will be marked as ignored (grey background) with a &quot;[not found]&quot; message; values that cannot be displayed because they have neither metadata nor support for str() will be marked as &quot;[cannot display]&quot; with an error (red) background. In the latter case, the column head will also be marked with the message &quot;metadata missing&quot; with a red background. The &quot;metadata missing&quot; message will not be generated if all the values in the column can be displayed using str(), however.</p>
<p>DisplayUtility cannot be invoked directly as a fixture. This may be changed in release 0.9.</p>
<p>The MusicPlayer example shows how it can be used.</p>
