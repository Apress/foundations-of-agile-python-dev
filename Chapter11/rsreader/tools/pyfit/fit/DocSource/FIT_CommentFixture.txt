CommentFixture
==============

The Comment fixture, originally part of FitNesse, is a fixture that does nothing. You use it when you want to put a table in a FIT test without having the table evaluated as part of the test.

Originally it marked all cells as ignored. This was changed in release 0.8 to not mark the cells of the table in any way.
