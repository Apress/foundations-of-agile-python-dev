Import Fixture
==============

The Import fixture lets you control where FIT looks for fixture renames and remembered packages. Entries with a name in the first column only are remembered packages; entires with two names are fixture renames. A version of the table with only one column is acceptable.

The single entry version is for compatability with FitNesse. 

It should be placed in the acceptance test before any fixtures that need it. The fit
package itself is always predeclared.

+---------------------+-------------------+
| fit.Import                              |
+---------------------+-------------------+
| spam.eggs.toast     |                   |
+---------------------+-------------------+
| spaghetti.meatballs |                   |
+---------------------+-------------------+
| fat                 | fat.Spec1_1Tests  |
+---------------------+-------------------+


It also declares that any names which begin with fat. will be changed to begin with fat.Spec1_1Tests. This is one of the entries that is used to map the Fit 1.1 specification tests to a more specific location.

NOTE - use of this fixture is strongly discouraged. It's here because it's heavily used in tests created by FitNesse. Future versions of PyFit may make this fixture a comment. Either the `application configuration`__ facility or the `fixture renames`__ facility is a significantly better replacement.
