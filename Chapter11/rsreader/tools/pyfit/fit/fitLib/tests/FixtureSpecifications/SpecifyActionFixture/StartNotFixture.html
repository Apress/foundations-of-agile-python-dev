<h2>The actor (<i>start</i> class) has to be a <i>Fixture</i> subclass</h2>
<p>There were two problems with this: first, java.awt.Point is not a
Python class, and second the exceptions were in the wrong place. I
changed java.awt.Point to fit.Counts.</p>
<table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td ColSpan=4>fitLib.FixtureFixture</td></tr>
<tr><td>fixture</td><td ColSpan=3>fit.ActionFixture</td></tr>
<tr><td>-e</td><td>start</td><td ColSpan=2>fit.Counts</td></tr>
<tr><td>-e</td><td>enter</td><td>x</td><td>12</td></tr>
</table>
Notice how subsequent rows of the table just above are interpreted even though the <i>start</i> failed. Similarly for the table below, where ActionFixture continues even though there is a problem (exception) with a row.<br>
<p>What subsequent rows? The comment is right, however.</p>
