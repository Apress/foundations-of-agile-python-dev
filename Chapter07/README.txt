There are three primary examples used in this chapter.  One
is produced without mock objects, one is produced using pmock,
and one is produced using pymock.

These three projects can be imported directly into eclipse
by selecting the General -> Import Existing Projects into Workspace
item from the Import dialog.  (On the Mac you bring this up
from the main menu by select File -> Import....)

The subdirectories containing the different project versions are:

rsreader_mockless

rsreader_pmock

rsreader_pymock
